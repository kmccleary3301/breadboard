Update a React/TypeScript component with a minor prop change that now breaks a Jest snapshot (`UserCard`/`ProfileCard`). Adjust the component and its tests/snapshots to match the new prop shape (title → heading, add optional subtitle). Keep styling and behavior consistent, avoid rewrites, and run the relevant Jest suite (e.g., `pnpm test --filter UserCard` or equivalent) to refresh snapshots and ensure passing tests.
