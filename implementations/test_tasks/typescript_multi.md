Refactor a small TypeScript/React todo feature spread across multiple files (`hooks/`, `components/`, `store/`). Goals: centralize item shape (`id`, `title`, `completed`, optional `notes`), align props/state types, and remove duplicated selectors. Update any affected tests and run the Jest suite (`pnpm test` or equivalent) to confirm everything passes. Keep changes scoped; avoid broad redesigns.
