id: grep
name: grep
description: '- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size

  - Searches file contents using regular expressions

  - Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", etc.)

  - Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")

  - Returns file paths and line numbers with at least one match sorted by modification
  time

  - Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns

  - If you need to identify/count the number of matches within files, use the Bash
  tool with `rg` (ripgrep) directly. Do NOT use `grep`.

  - When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing
  and grepping, use the Task tool instead
