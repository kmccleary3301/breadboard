description: 'Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly
  by using this tool.

  Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides
  a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does
  not exist; an error will be returned.


  Usage:

  - The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path

  - By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file

  - You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long
  files), but it''s recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters

  - Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated

  - Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1

  - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always
  better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.

  - If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system
  reminder warning in place of file contents.

  - You can read image files using this tool.
