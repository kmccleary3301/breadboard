description: 'Writes a file to the local filesystem.


  Usage:

  - This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.

  - If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file''s
  contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.

  - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless
  explicitly required.

  - NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create
  documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

  - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files
  unless asked.
