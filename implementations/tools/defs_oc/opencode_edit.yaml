description: "Performs exact string replacements in files. \n\nUsage:\n- You must\
  \ use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool\
  \ will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \n- When editing text\
  \ from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces)\
  \ as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is:\
  \ spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content\
  \ to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or\
  \ newString.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write\
  \ new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly\
  \ requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL\
  \ if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error \"oldString not found in\
  \ content\".\n- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the\
  \ file with an error \"oldString found multiple times and requires more code context\
  \ to uniquely identify the intended match\". Either provide a larger string with\
  \ more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every\
  \ instance of `oldString`. \n- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings\
  \ across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for\
  \ instance.\n"
