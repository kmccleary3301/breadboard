description: "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\
  \nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- build: This subagent\
  \ should only be called manually by the user.\n- plan: This subagent should only\
  \ be called manually by the user.\n- general: General-purpose agent for researching\
  \ complex questions and executing multi-step tasks. Use this agent to execute multiple\
  \ units of work in parallel.\n- explore: Contextual grep for codebases. Answers\
  \ \"Where is X?\", \"Which file has Y?\", \"Find the code that does Z\". Fire multiple\
  \ in parallel for broad searches. Specify thoroughness: \"quick\" for basic, \"\
  medium\" for moderate, \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis.\n- Planner-Sisyphus:\
  \ Plan agent (OhMyOpenCode version)\n- oracle: Expert technical advisor with deep\
  \ reasoning for architecture decisions, code analysis, and engineering guidance.\n\
  - librarian: Specialized codebase understanding agent for multi-repository analysis,\
  \ searching remote codebases, retrieving official documentation, and finding implementation\
  \ examples using GitHub CLI, Context7, and Web Search. MUST BE USED when users ask\
  \ to look up code in remote repositories, explain library internals, or find usage\
  \ examples in open source.\n- frontend-ui-ux-engineer: A designer-turned-developer\
  \ who crafts stunning UI/UX even without design mockups. Code may be a bit messy,\
  \ but the visual output is always fire.\n- document-writer: A technical writer who\
  \ crafts clear, comprehensive documentation. Specializes in README files, API docs,\
  \ architecture docs, and user guides. MUST BE USED when executing documentation\
  \ tasks from ai-todo list plans.\n- multimodal-looker: Analyze media files (PDFs,\
  \ images, diagrams) that require interpretation beyond raw text. Extracts specific\
  \ information or summaries from documents, describes visual content. Use when you\
  \ need analyzed/extracted data rather than literal file contents.\n- grep-summarizer:\
  \ Read-only grep specialist (search for strings and report matches).\n- repo-scanner:\
  \ Read-only repo scanner (list structure, summarize layout).\n\nWhen using the Task\
  \ tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to\
  \ use.\n\nWhen to use the Task tool:\n- When you are instructed to execute custom\
  \ slash commands. Use the Task tool with the slash command invocation as the entire\
  \ prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"\
  Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\n\nWhen NOT to use the\
  \ Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool\
  \ instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching\
  \ for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead,\
  \ to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific\
  \ file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find\
  \ the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions\
  \ above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible,\
  \ to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n\
  2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result\
  \ returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result,\
  \ you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the\
  \ result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless unless you provide a session_id.\
  \ Your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to\
  \ perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent\
  \ should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4. The agent's\
  \ outputs should generally be trusted\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect\
  \ it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.),\
  \ since it is not aware of the user's intent\n6. If the agent description mentions\
  \ that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without\
  \ the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage (NOTE:\
  \ The agents below are fictional examples for illustration only - use the actual\
  \ agents listed above):\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use\
  \ this agent after you are done writing a significant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\"\
  : use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\
  \n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\n\
  assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant:\
  \ First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is\
  \ prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n\
  <code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i *\
  \ i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n\
  <commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed,\
  \ now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant:\
  \ Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the\
  \ Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"\
  Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent\
  \ to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use\
  \ the Task tool to launch the with the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n"
