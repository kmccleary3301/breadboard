description: 'Execute a slash command within the main conversation.


  When you use this tool, the slash command gets expanded to a full prompt that provides
  detailed instructions on how to complete the task.


  How slash commands work:

  - Invoke commands using this tool with the command name (without arguments)

  - The command''s prompt will expand and provide detailed instructions

  - Arguments from user input should be passed separately


  Important:

  - Only use commands listed in Available Commands below

  - Do not invoke a command that is already running

  - **CRITICAL**: When user''s message starts with ''/'' (e.g., "/commit", "/plan"),
  you MUST immediately invoke this tool with that command. Do NOT attempt to handle
  the command manually.


  Commands are loaded from (priority order, highest wins):

  - .opencode/command/ (opencode-project - OpenCode project-specific commands)

  - ./.claude/commands/ (project - Claude Code project-specific commands)

  - ~/.config/opencode/command/ (opencode - OpenCode global commands)

  - ~/.claude/commands/ (user - Claude Code global commands)


  Each command is a markdown file with:

  - YAML frontmatter: description, argument-hint, model, agent, subtask (optional)

  - Markdown body: The command instructions/prompt

  - File references: @path/to/file (relative to command file location)

  - Shell injection: `!`command`` (executes and injects output)
