description: "Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current\
  \ coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate\
  \ thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the\
  \ task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse\
  \ this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When\
  \ a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex\
  \ tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly\
  \ requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4.\
  \ User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done\
  \ (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately\
  \ capture user requirements as todos. Feel free to edit the todo list based on new\
  \ information.\n6. After completing a task - Mark it complete and add any new follow-up\
  \ tasks\n7. When you start working on a new task, mark the todo as in_progress.\
  \ Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time. Complete existing\
  \ tasks before starting new ones.\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using\
  \ this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task\
  \ is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can\
  \ be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational\
  \ or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one\
  \ trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\
  \n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark\
  \ mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build\
  \ when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application\
  \ settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo\
  \ list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings\
  \ page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS\
  \ styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n\
  5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins\
  \ working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n\
  1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and\
  \ styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n\
  3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests\
  \ and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n\
  User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my\
  \ project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences\
  \ of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in\
  \ the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different\
  \ files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with\
  \ specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant\
  \ used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the\
  \ scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files,\
  \ it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps\
  \ ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach\
  \ prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n\
  </example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce\
  \ site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\n\
  Assistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features\
  \ to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific\
  \ tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration.\
  \ This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms\
  \ that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant\
  \ used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to\
  \ implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large\
  \ features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress\
  \ across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser:\
  \ Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance\
  \ issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let\
  \ me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews\
  \ component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant:\
  \ After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let\
  \ me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with\
  \ items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList,\
  \ 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in\
  \ Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle\
  \ size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for\
  \ the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\n\
  The assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the\
  \ codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it\
  \ identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is\
  \ a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically\
  \ track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures\
  \ all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples\
  \ of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World'\
  \ in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple\
  \ code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\"\
  \ to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not\
  \ use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed\
  \ in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward\
  \ request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status\
  \ command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your\
  \ working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged,\
  \ which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental\
  \ command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\
  \n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational\
  \ request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for\
  \ an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n\
  </example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function\
  \ to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal\
  \ function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the\
  \ calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list\
  \ because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the\
  \ code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n\
  </reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me\
  \ what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes:\
  \ npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output\
  \ of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your\
  \ package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because\
  \ this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple\
  \ steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward\
  \ task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task\
  \ States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n\
  \   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed:\
  \ Task finished successfully\n   - cancelled: Task no longer needed\n\n2. **Task\
  \ Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks\
  \ complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have\
  \ ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting\
  \ new ones\n   - Cancel tasks that become irrelevant\n\n3. **Task Breakdown**:\n\
  \   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller,\
  \ manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use\
  \ this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and\
  \ ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n"
