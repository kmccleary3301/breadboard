description: "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe Task tool launches specialized\
  \ agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available\
  \ to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type\
  \ parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file\
  \ path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a\
  \ specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are\
  \ searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the\
  \ match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include\
  \ a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible,\
  \ to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return\
  \ a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result,\
  \ you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents\
  \ in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput\
  \ to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run - When you need their results\
  \ to continue you can use TaskOutput in blocking mode to pause and wait for their results.\n- Agents can be resumed using\
  \ the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its\
  \ full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task\
  \ description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with\
  \ its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts\
  \ so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\"\
  \ can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that\
  \ reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent\
  \ will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly\
  \ tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since\
  \ it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you\
  \ should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies\
  \ that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks.\
  \ For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message\
  \ with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are\
  \ done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with\
  \ a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is\
  \ prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write\
  \ tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following\
  \ code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i\
  \ === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the\
  \ task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer\
  \ agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\n\
  user: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n\
  </commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n"
