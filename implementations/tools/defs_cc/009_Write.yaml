  - If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file''s contents. This tool will fail if you
  did not read the file first.

  - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.

  - NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested
  by the User.

  - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.'
