description: "Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off\
  \ on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan\
  \ mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This\
  \ Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions\
  \ apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\"\
  \ - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\
  \n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the\
  \ API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies\
  \ possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the\
  \ login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\
  \n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time\
  \ updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\
  \n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication\
  \ system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before\
  \ understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example:\
  \ \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could\
  \ reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n\
  \   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode\
  \ for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with\
  \ clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration\
  \ tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly\
  \ explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an\
  \ implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify\
  \ approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\n\
  User: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens,\
  \ middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first,\
  \ significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\
  \nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog,\
  \ API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user\
  \ should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward,\
  \ no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"\
  What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES\
  \ user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning -\
  \ it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes\
  \ are made to their codebase\n"
