description: "Performs exact string replacements in files. \n\nUsage:\n- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the\
  \ conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \n- When editing text\
  \ from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix.\
  \ The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to\
  \ match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing\
  \ files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests\
  \ it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either\
  \ provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance\
  \ of `old_string`. \n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if\
  \ you want to rename a variable for instance."
