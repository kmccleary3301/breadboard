description: "Execute a skill within the main conversation\n\n<skills_instructions>\nWhen users ask you to perform tasks,\
  \ check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities\
  \ and domain knowledge.\n\nHow to invoke:\n- Use this tool with the skill name only (no arguments)\n- Examples:\n  - `skill:\
  \ \"pdf\"` - invoke the pdf skill\n  - `skill: \"xlsx\"` - invoke the xlsx skill\n  - `skill: \"ms-office-suite:pdf\"` -\
  \ invoke using fully qualified name\n\nImportant:\n- When a skill is relevant, you must invoke this tool IMMEDIATELY as\
  \ your first action\n- NEVER just announce or mention a skill in your text response without actually calling this tool\n\
  - This is a BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: invoke the relevant Skill tool BEFORE generating any other response about the task\n-\
  \ Only use skills listed in <available_skills> below\n- Do not invoke a skill that is already running\n- Do not use this\
  \ tool for built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)\n</skills_instructions>\n\n<available_skills>\n\n</available_skills>\n"
