name: Glob
description: '- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size

  - Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"

  - Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time

  - Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns

  - When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool
  instead

  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel
  if they are potentially useful.'
