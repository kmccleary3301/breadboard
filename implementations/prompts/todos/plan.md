### TODO Workflow (Planning)

1. Draft a numbered checklist of the smallest actionable steps needed to satisfy the request.
2. Call `todo.create` for each checklist item before attempting any edits or shell commands.
3. Reference key files, directories, or tests in the todo item metadata so future turns can locate the work quickly.
4. Update or reorder todos if the plan changes; keep the list minimal and high-signal.
