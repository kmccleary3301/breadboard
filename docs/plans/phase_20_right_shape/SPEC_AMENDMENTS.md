# Phase 20 Spec Amendments

Every deviation from BB_RS_MASTER_PLAN.md is recorded here, dated, with evidence (§1.5 spec_gap protocol).

Current state: **1 amendment** (below).

## Amendment 1 — 2026-07-10 — Shared immutable interpreter for packet worktrees (spec_gap)

**Rule amended:** §1.1 Interpreter rule.
**Gap:** the rule resolves `PYTHON="$REPO_ROOT/.venv/bin/python"` per packet; packet isolation (§1.2) executes packets in git worktrees, which have no `.venv`. Bootstrapping a full venv per worktree duplicates an identical environment 6+ times per wave for zero isolation benefit (gates never mutate the env).
**Amendment:** a packet worktree MAY use the integration checkout's interpreter (`/Users/kylemccleary/projects/breadboard/breadboard_repo_integration_main_20260326/.venv/bin/python`) as `$PYTHON` iff (1) `requirements.txt` at the packet's base SHA is byte-identical to the integration checkout's — recorded digest `sha256:9f19031842d0d2c2d51e39aa3deda5500ec70c530b872890aaaed0883eebd65f`; (2) no gate mutates the environment (any `pip install` requires a fresh env + explicit evidence); (3) packet evidence records the interpreter path + this digest. Gates that REQUIRE a fresh environment (G1 fresh-venv editable-install test, G6 temp-checkout E2E) still bootstrap their own per the original rule.
**Interpreter:** Python 3.11.15 at `/Users/kylemccleary/projects/breadboard/breadboard_repo_integration_main_20260326/.venv/bin/python`.
**Recorded by:** orchestrating agent, session bootstrap, branch e4/workspace-restore-20260708 @ 3b8d862f.
