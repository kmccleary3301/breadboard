❯ Explain the difference between UDP and TCP in 6 bullet points.

● UDP vs TCP

  - Connection Model: TCP is connection-oriented (establishes a connection before sending data), while UDP is
  connectionless (sends data directly without setup)
  - Reliability: TCP guarantees reliable, ordered delivery of all data; UDP offers no delivery guarantees and may
  lose or reorder packets
  - Speed: UDP is faster with lower latency due to minimal overhead; TCP is slower due to connection management and
  error-checking
  - Header Size: TCP has a larger header (20+ bytes) with more control information; UDP has a minimal 8-byte header
  - Use Cases: TCP suits applications requiring accuracy (email, file transfer, web browsing); UDP suits applications
   prioritizing speed (video streaming, online gaming, DNS)
  - Error Checking: TCP performs extensive error detection and correction; UDP has basic checksum validation but
  doesn't retransmit corrupted packets
